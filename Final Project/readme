to run the model, just go to school hpc
for single node execution run
1. cd to BERT or mingpt foler depends on which model you want to run
2. for single node execution of the program: torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=<GPU> main.py, <GPU> is the number of gpu or your worker node
3. for multi nodes execution of the program:
    1. start multiple worker nodes
    2. in each worker node run: torchrun --nproc_per_node=<GPU> --nnodes=2 --node_rank=0 --rdzv_id=<RDN> --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=<IP> main.py
       Here, <GPU> is number of gpu of the worker node, this can be different for different node
       <RDN> is just random integer such as 123
       <IP> of your worker node, for example, in school hpc, this is something like classt02, classt03
